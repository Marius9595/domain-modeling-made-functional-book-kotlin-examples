# Domain Modeling Made Functional Book - Kotlin Examples


This a repository where I will code what the author propose in the book. 

I will just share practical things (see [LogBook](/LogBookOfPracticalStudy) to see what I done along the time ) and code.
However I take notes from the book, I am publishing it here: [My Notes From The Book](https://marius9595.github.io/cerebro-digital-con-quartz/Bibliograf%C3%ADa/Libros/Domain-Modeling-Made-Functional)

## Starting!

I created a new springboot project with Copilot to host the examples in case of I need to use some REST API in the future examples of
code.

The purpose of these entries is to log and summarize the practical content that I will 
code while I re-read the book again to gain more practical knowledge about DDD with functional programming perspective.

In this chapter the author introduces the business problem to be solved through the chapters of the book: **An
Order-Taking System**

The author demonstrates how to discover the domain and the result is the following after Event Storming session:

The next day I will continue with the next chapter to extract the relevant practical information.
